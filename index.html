        <p>Cleaning data is important because it makes sure the information, we use is accurate, consistent, and complete. It fixes mistakes, standardizes formats, fills in missing pieces, and removes irrelevant details. This helps us trust the data and get better results in analysis, decision-making, and creating machine learning models. Clean data also ensures we meet regulatory standards, saves time and resources, and leads to clearer insights and better decisions.</p>

        <h3>Social Buzz’s content performance</h3>
        <img src="for.png" alt="Emergency Response Dashboard Screenshot">
        <p>Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media and content creation platform founded in 2010 by former engineers
from a major social media conglomerate, is based in San Francisco with 250 employees. Emphasizing anonymous
user interactions with over 100 reaction types, Social
Buzz has scaled to 500 million active users monthly. This
growth has resulted in massive amounts of unstructured
data that require sophisticated and expensive
technology to manage. As they prepare for an IPO by the
end of next year, they seek external expertise to oversee
their scaling process, implement data best practices, and
analyze their content categories for the most popular
trends.</p>
